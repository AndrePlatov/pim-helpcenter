# Manage interface & users

## Set the default PIM language

Most user interfaces in the PIM are translated. For more information about how we manage translations, please refer to the end of this guide section «How to participate to Akeneo PIM translation?». You can set a default language for the interface, that will be used for all new users.

> **Note**
  that each user can configure the interface in its own language. For instance your German team can have the PIM interface in German, whereas the US team will have the PIM in American English - this can be set in their user account (refer to the end-user guide (Manage your user account).

### Choose the default language

1.  Log in with a user account with the rights to “System” menu.
1.  Go to System/Configuration

1.  Click on “Save” to apply your settings

All users in the PIM can see the firstname and lastname of other users in the application.

The user management and their access rights is available only if the rights have been given to the user.

Any PIM user can see his own account details, update his/her password, and set his/her preferences (eg working environment for local and channel).
