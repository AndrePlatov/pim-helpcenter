# Manage locales

An Akeneo locale is a combination of a language (English, German, French...) and a country (United States, United Kingdom, France…). Examples: English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU). You can have one or more locales activated in your PIM. In the Enterprise Edition, you can define specific user rights on locales.

A product in Akeneo can have different values per locale for some attributes (these attributes are “localizable”). Akeneo proposes more than 200 locales.

The locales are used to set values for attributes which may differ according to the relevant language/locale.

To activate a locale, you need to add it to at least one channel. Unused locales are inactive.

### Locale’s grid pagination

The locale’s grid displays between 10 and 100 locales per page. By default, the grid displays 25 locales per page, you can change this by clicking on «View per page» and select the number of locales you wish to see per page.

## Filter on locales

The locale’s grid comes with a filter bar. You can filter on the locale’s code and its status: Activated: Yes/No.

Enter your criteria. If the displayed criteria are not sufficient or relevant you can add additional criteria by selecting from the list that appears via the “Manage filters” button. The grid is automatically updated as a new filter is added.

## Sort out locales

To sort out locales, you can click on a column header in the grid. You can sort them on code or on their status.
