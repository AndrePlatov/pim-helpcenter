## Help us translate the PIM

By default, Akeneo PIM is set in English, we usually manage to translate the wording in French internally. Thanks to some of our employees, we have managed to translated some other languages like Russian, Portuguese... but for other languages you might miss some wordings.

Akeneo uses the application [Crowdin]( https://fr.crowdin.com/) which provides a collaborative environment for the community to translate the PIM. Sometimes some translations are missing in different languages, depending on the contributions of the community, feel free to create an account and submit translations for your language!

Access to Crowdin is free, simply register to access to Akeneo project and start contributing!  
[https://fr.crowdin.com/project/akeneo](https://fr.crowdin.com/project/akeneo) For now, here is the current status on PIM translation on Crowdin.

## Badger Program

As part of our Contributing Program, you can also claim badges! For more information, check the dedicated GitHub repository: https://github.com/akeneo/badger.

Amongst available badges get your “El Translator” badge when you help us translate the PIM, the “Core Contributor” when you merge your 1st Pull Request on our PIM Community Edition and so on!
