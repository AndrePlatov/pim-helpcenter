# Manage currencies

You have 294 currencies available in Akeneo. Currencies are used to set values for the “Price” attribute type. Currencies are not related to locales.

When a “Price” attribute type is created, it can have as many values as needed as long as the relevant currency has been activated in the PIM.

## View currencies
