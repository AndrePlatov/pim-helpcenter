# Improved measurement families

## Add your own measurement units and families

In order to give you more flexibility over your catalog structure, we improved the way we manage measurements in the PIM. Alongside standard measurement families (eg. weight, length, volume...), you can now create your custom measurement families per your needs (eg. inductance, luminance...).

You now have full control over your measurement families: you can also add the units you deem necessary (Henry, Lambert...) or even delete measurement units or measurement families that you are not using.

## New standard measurement units and families
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"
:::

We added four new standard measurement families: `Force`, `Angle`, `Capacitance` and `Volume Flow` to better fit your needs in terms of product modeling.

Also, we completed some existing standard measurement families with new units:
- in `Pressure`: bar, pascal, etc.
- in `Binary`: kilobit, megabit, etc.
- in `Length`: micrometer and nautical mile units
- in `Volume`: microliter and hectoliter units
- in `Weight`: microgram unit

Of course, these new measurement families and units come with preset conversion operations to help you save some time.
