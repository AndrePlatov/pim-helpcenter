Easily handle product compatibility in your PIM thanks to our brand new two-way association type! This new association type is now available under `Settings`/`Association types`.

If you choose the two-way association type, and associate product A with product B, product B will automatically be associated with product A.

Use a two-way association if you need to easily link substitute or replacement items, or products that are compatible such as appliances and spare parts.
