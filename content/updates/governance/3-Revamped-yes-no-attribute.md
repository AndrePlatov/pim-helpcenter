## Better filter with the Yes/No attribute
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false"

Two new operators `is empty` and `is not empty` are now available in the product grid and in the [Rules Builder](../articles/manage-your-rules.html#the-rule-builder-tab), to help you filter on Yes/No attributes. These new filters will help you to easily find what you were looking for in the product grid and be even more precise while building your rules.

The first one, `is empty`, allows you to find products and product models that have no value for a specific Yes/No attribute. The second one, `is not empty`, allows you to search for the opposite.

## Default value for the Yes/No attribute
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false"

You can now define a default value for each of your Yes/No attributes. This will definitely help you be more productive and swiftly reach your completeness goals. This new feature can also be used to initialize workflows based on Yes/No attributes.
