To offer greater flexibility when dealing with variant products, you can now easily transform them into simple products directly from the PIM interface. Quite a game changer when you need to refine your family variants! You can also use it if your product range now contains one product instead of several.

On a side note, this new feature will also help you change the family variants of your product model more efficiently. A real time saver indeed.

## Update the variant axis value of your product models

Sometimes, when new variant products are created, their variant axis can be set to a value that is not precisely the one you wanted. It is now possible to change this value afterward, making your product modeling even more flexible. And you already know this: under-control product information governance is the key to unlock powerful product experiences.
