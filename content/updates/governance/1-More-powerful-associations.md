# More powerful product associations

## New association type with quantities
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-association-types.html#create-an-association-type-with-quantities"
:::

The new association type with quantities enables you to create product sets. You can associate several products together and define quantities for each of them. 

For instance, you can easily create a dining table set composed of 1 table and 4 chairs, or a bedding set with 1 duvet cover and 2 pillowcases.

Once you have created the right association type, and associated your products in the PIM, it will look like this:

## New two-way association type
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-association-types.html#create-a-2-way-association-type"
:::

Easily handle product compatibility in your PIM thanks to our brand new two-way association type! If you choose this new association type, and associate product A with product B, product B will automatically be associated with product A.

Use a two-way association if you need to easily link substitute or replacement items, or products that are compatible such as appliances and spare parts.

## Small UI improvements
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"

We made some small improvements to make your life easier when working with product associations:
- We now display the total number of associations per product or product model close to the `Associations` tab in your product form. 
- We also show you the total number of associations per association type, directly on your product associations page.

- From the `Associations` tab, you can now click on an associated product or product model to open it in a new tab.
- Finally, you can now see the label of the product you are working on in the association pop-up window so you keep track of what you are doing.
