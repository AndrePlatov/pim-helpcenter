# Review your proposals more efficiently
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity, Collaboration" available="late April" in="EE" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO"

We're glad to introduce the revamp of our proposals screen. It's now even more practical and efficient for those of you who, depending on their catalog rights, need to review the enrichment work of teammates. 

Among other improvements, you can notice that:
- Proposals are now gathered by product. It will surely help you be more productive when validating or discarding proposals.
- You also now have, directly from within the proposal, a preview of your PDFs assets, your YouTube links, and your reference entity records. A great time-saver when reviewing them!
