You can now benefit from spell-checking on category names, attributes and option labels to guarantee consistency on your customer-facing product data.

You can now check spelling mistakes and correct them in your categories and attributes data quality in the `Settings` pages. 
This improvement is also available in the `Product Edit Form`. New recommendations are listed should we find errors. The better the content, the higher the consistency grade :wink:
