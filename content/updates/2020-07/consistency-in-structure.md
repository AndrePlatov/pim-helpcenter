We keep on adding new features to help you improve your data quality. To garantee consistency on your customer-facing product data, we introduced spell-check in category names, attribute and options labels.
You can now check spelling mistakes and correct them in your categories and attributes data quality in the `Settings`. 
This improvement is also available in the `Product Edit Form`. New recommendations are listed should we find errors. The better the content, the higher the consistency grade :wink:
