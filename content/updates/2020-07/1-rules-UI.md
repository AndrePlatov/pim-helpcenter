# A brand new UI to manage your rules

In order to let everyone use the rules engine and boost your productivity, we have created a user interface to manage your rules directly in the PIM.  

We know that your time is precious and that you always need to work efficiently. That's why we built the rules engine a few years ago.
Indeed, this feature allows you to automate actions on a selection of products/product models. But until now, the only way to create/update rules was via a YML file import, which was not simple enough for our non-technical users.  

Thanks to this brand new user interface, you'll be able to create/update your rules with only some clicks :wink:.
