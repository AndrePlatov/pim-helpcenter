# A brand new UI to manage your rules

We know that your time is precious. That's why we built the rules engine few years ago. This feature allows you to automate actions on a selection of products/product models.   
Until now, the only way to create/update rules was via a YML file import, which was not simple enough for our non-technical users.  
In order to let everyone use the rules engine, we have created a user interface to manage your rules directly in the PIM.
