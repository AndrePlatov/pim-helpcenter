# A new relative date format
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-July" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#created.html"
:::

You can now create a rule based on a **relative date** condition. This new condition can be currently used only through YML import (it will be shortly available in our brand new rules engine screen!) and for the `updated` and `created` system attributes and the `date` attribute type.

It's already possible to apply conditions on products/product models based on their `creation date`, `updated date`, or the content of a `date` attribute type. But we wanted to go further, by allowing you to not only filter on **specific dates** but also **relative dates**. With this new functionality, you'll be able to apply an action on all products created/updated since the past X days.
