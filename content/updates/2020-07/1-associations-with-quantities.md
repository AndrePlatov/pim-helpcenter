# New: association type with quantities
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product Associations" available="early July" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-association-types.html#create-an-association-type-with-quantities"
:::

With the new association type with quantities, you are now able to create a product set composed of other products that are associated with different quantities for each one.

For example, it is now possible to create a dining table set composed of 1 table and 4 chairs, just like this one (picture courtesy of Made.com):

![This is a product set composed of different associated products with quantities](../img/ryland-extending-dining-table-and-4-chairs-set-walnut-and-black_made.com.png)

This new feature was highly requested, why not giving it a try right now? :wink:
