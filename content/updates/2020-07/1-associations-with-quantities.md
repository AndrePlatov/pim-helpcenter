# New: association type with quantities
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product Associations" available="early July" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-association-types.html#create-an-association-type-with-quantities"
:::

With the new association type with quantities, you are now able to create a product set composed of other products that are associated with different quantities for each one.

For example, it is now possible to create a dining table set composed of 1 table, 1 stool and 2 chairs, just like this one:

This new feature was highly requested, why not giving it a try right now? :wink:
