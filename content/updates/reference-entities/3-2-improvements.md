# New improvements in 3.2

The reference entities feature includes two new improvements that make managing reference entities more robust.

## New number attribute type
This new capability enables reference entities to have attribute types with numeric values. 

In the example below, a new `Creation Year` attribute uses a numeric attribute type. Values can optionally be specified as decimals, and minimum and maximum values are also supported to help ensure high quality product data.

## Find which products are linked to a given reference entity
Version 3.2 introduces a new Products tab so you can easily access products directly from the reference entity record.  
By default, the first 20 products are listed. Above the grid the total number of linked products are noted.

To see all products, simply click `View all products`. To view or edit a linked product, simply click on it and it will open its product form.

The advantage of this feature is that PIM users can see at a glance what products are linked to a given reference entity, and rapidly access a product directly from the reference entities screen, saving clicks, enhancing productivity, and delivering a better user experience.
