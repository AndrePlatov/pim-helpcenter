# Better manage product models and variants in the grid

You work a lot with product models and their variants? You will enjoy these simple yet efficient new improvements we delivered in the product grid.

## Filter on the product typology
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-product-typology"
:::

The new `Product typology` filter in the product grid allows you to choose whether to display only the simple products or only the variant products. Pretty useful when you want to quickly find different variant products in different product models, for instance.

## Product variant display option

:::

The product grid also benefits from a new display option: the `Variant` display option. It allows you to show your models' product variants, instead of only these product models. This way, you can easily find and work at your product variant level. What a time saver!

## Filter on the product identifier
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

Filtering on your product model identifiers has now arrived in your product grid! So neat!

## Products and product models counters
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

The product grid counter at the top of the page is also revamped to be more intelligible. We now show you the number of products and the number of product models. Crystal clear!
