# Better manage product models and variants in the grid

Do you work a lot with product models and variants? If yes, you will surely enjoy these simple but yet efficient improvements we made in the product grid: a new filter on the product type, a new display option...

## Filter on the product typology
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-product-typology"
:::

The new `Product typology` filter in the product grid allows you to choose to display only the simple products or only the variant products. It's pretty useful if you need to quickly find different variant products in different product models, for instance.

## Product variant display option

:::

The product grid also benefits from a new display option: the `Variant` display option. Use it if you want to list your product variants in the grid, instead of listing their product models. Thanks to this new option, you do not need anymore to first click on a product model to access its variants. What a time saver!

## Filter on the product identifier
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-the-identifier"
:::

Filtering on your product model identifiers has now arrived in your product grid! So neat!

## Products and product models counters
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late October"
:::

The product grid counter at the top of the page is also revamped to be more intelligible. We now show you the number of products and the number of product models. Crystal clear!
