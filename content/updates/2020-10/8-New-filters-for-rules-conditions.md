# New filters for rules conditions
::: meta-data type="New" features="Automation, Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/.html"
:::

In the Rules engine, create more efficient rules conditions thanks to these 4 new filters:
- On the entity type, i.e., to choose whether to target product models or products,
- On family variants,
- On product or product model parents,
- On identifiers.

Remember that the more precise your rule condition is, the more performant your rule will be. So don't hesitate to overuse those new filters. ðŸ˜‰
