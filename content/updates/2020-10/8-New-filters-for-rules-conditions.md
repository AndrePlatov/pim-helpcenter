# New filters for rules conditions
::: meta-data type="New" features="Automation, Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#available-conditions"
:::

We added new filters in the rules engine to help you better define your conditions. You can now filter on:
- the entity type: to target product models or products and product variants,
- family variants: to target products belonging to one or several family variants, or products with one or no family variant,
- parents: to target specific product parents or products without parents
- identifiers: to target specific products based on their product identifiers.

Condition filters enable you to narrow the product selection to apply the rules on, so the more precise your rule conditions are, the faster your rule will be run. So don't hesitate to use those new filters.
