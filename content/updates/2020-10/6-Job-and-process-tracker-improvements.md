:::

When you launch a quick product export from the product grid, you can now easily jump to this task's progress detail in the process tracker. Indeed, you'll find a link to the job detail directly inside the flash message that confirms the quick export launch.

## Process tracker display enhancements

:::

Quickly find a launched job thanks to the new `User` filter we introduced in the process tracker grid. It will allow you to either easily find your own jobs or the ones launched by one of your colleagues. Neat!

On a side note, you will also notice that you can order the process tracker grid jobs by the user who launched it.
