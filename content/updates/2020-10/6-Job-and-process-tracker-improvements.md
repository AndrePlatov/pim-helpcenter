# Jobs and process tracker improvements

Check our latest process tracker enhancements: a progress bar and the estimated remaining time for your ongoing jobs, a shortcut for a rapid access to quick exports job details, and a new sorting option in the process tracker grid.

## Progress bar and time left for your ongoing jobs
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="late October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

In the process tracker, in the detail of each ongoing job, we now compute an estimation of the time left for each job step. A progress bar is also displayed.

## Easy access to the detail of your quick export once launched
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="mid-October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

When you launch a quick product export from the product grid, you can now easily jump to this task's progress detail in the process tracker. Indeed, you'll find a link to the job detail directly inside the flash message that confirms the quick export launch.

## Process tracker display enhancements
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

Quickly find a launched job thanks to the new `User` filter we introduced in the process tracker grid. It will allow you to either easily find your own jobs or the ones launched by one of your colleagues. Neat!

On a side note, you will also notice that you can order the process tracker grid jobs by the user who launched it.
