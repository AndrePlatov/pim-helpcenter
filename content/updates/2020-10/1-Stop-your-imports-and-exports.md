# Stop your imports and exports
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="late October" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

A brand new `Stop` button is now displayed in your process tracker. It allows you to stop Excel and CSV imports/exports you launched. Super helpful whenever you launch a job by mistake and don't want to wait for it to execute until the end. ðŸ˜‰

A new `Allowed to stop a job` permission allows you to fine-tune which user roles will be able to see this new action.
