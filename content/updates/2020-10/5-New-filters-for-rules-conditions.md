# New filters for rules conditions
::: meta-data type="New" features="Automation, Productivity" available="early October" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#available-conditions"
:::

New filters are available in the rules engine to help you better define your conditions. You can now filter on:
- the entity type: to target product models or products and variant products,
- family variants: to target products belonging to one or several family variants, or products with one or no family variant,
- parents: to target specific product parents or products without parents
- identifiers: to target specific products based on their product identifiers.

Condition filters enable you to narrow down the product selection for a given rule. The more precise your rule conditions, the faster it will be run. So don't hesitate to use those new filters.
