# Welcome to our new Settings menu!
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="early May" in="EE,GE"

We released a brand new page to access your PIM Settings. They are now organized into two main categories: `Catalog` and `Product` settings. Under each entry, you will see the number of entities already created in your PIM (number of attributes, categories, associations...).
