# Enhanced rule management

## Quickly duplicate your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#duplicate-a-rule"
:::

Sometimes you can have very similar rules with just one different condition or action. In order to avoid rewriting the whole rule, you can now duplicate it in two clicks! What a time-saver, isn't it?

## Define a status for your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#define-a-status-for-a-rule"
:::

You can now easily enable or disable your rules. Very useful when the creation or edition of your rule is not finished yet! Setting its status to `disabled` will pause the automatic execution of the rule. 
Once the rule is ready, you just have to enable it to let it run!

## Name your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true"
:::

You can now name your rules with a clear label. You can also define a rule's name per PIM locale enabled. The rule's label is visible in your rules grid and in your smart attributes: if you have international teams you can now make sure that they understand the purpose of a rule.

## New action tags for your rules
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="true"

From now on, you can see at a glance the action type behind each rule (add, copy, concatenate, set, calculate, remove, clear) in the rules grid. To ease your readability, each action type has its own color. :wink:
