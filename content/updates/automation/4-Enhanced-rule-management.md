# Enhanced rule management

## Quickly duplicate your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#duplicate-a-rule"
:::

Sometimes you can have very similar rules with just one different condition. In order to avoid rewriting the whole rule, you can now duplicate it in two clicks! What a time-saver, isn't it?

## Define a status for your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#define-a-status-for-a-rule"
:::

You can now easily enable or disable your rules. Very useful when the creation or edition of your rule is not finished yet! Setting its status to `disabled` will pause the automatic execution of the rule. 
Once the rule is ready, you just have to enable it to let it run!

## Name your rules
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#name-your-rules"
:::

You can now name your rules with a clear label. You can also define a rule name per PIM locale enabled. The rule label is visible under your rules grid and under your smart attributes: if you have international teams you can now make sure that they understand the purpose of a rule.

## New action tags for your rules
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#view-all-rules"
:::

From now on, you can see at a glance the action type behind each rule (add, copy, concatenate, set, calculate, remove, clear) in the rules grid. To ease your readability, each action type has its own color. :wink:
