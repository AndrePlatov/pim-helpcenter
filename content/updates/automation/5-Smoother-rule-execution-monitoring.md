Every time you run a rule, a rule execution operation row appears in your dashboard under the latest operations as well as in the process tracker. As with any other job or operation, the detailed execution page is only one click away. This execution page will inform you if the rule went well or if it generated any errors or warnings, and will tell you how to correct them.
