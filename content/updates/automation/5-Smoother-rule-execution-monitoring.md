From now on, every time you run a rule, a rule execution operation line will appear in your dashboard under the last operations as well as in the process tracker. Like for any other job or operation, you can access the detailed execution page with a click. This execution page will inform you if the rule went fine or if it raised any errors or warnings, and give you guidance on how to fix them.
