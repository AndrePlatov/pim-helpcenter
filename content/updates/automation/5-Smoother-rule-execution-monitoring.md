# Smoother rule execution monitoring

From now on, every time you run a rule, a rule execution operation row will appear in your dashboard under the latest operations as well as in the process tracker. As with any other job or operation, you can access the detailed execution page with one click. This execution page will inform you if the rule went well or if it generated any errors or warnings, and will tell you how to correct them.
