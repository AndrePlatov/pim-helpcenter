Our Rules engine enables you to automate enrichment actions on specific product selections. To make easier its use and boost your productivity, we are very glad to announce the introduction of a brand new user interface to directly manage your rules from within the PIM. :champagne:

In just a few clicks, you are now autonomous to create, update and delete rules. We hope it will definitely make rules management easier and faster for you. You'll find this feature under the `Rules builder` tab after you click on a rule in your rule grid.

Note the imports of YML files to create or update rules remain available.
