# Exports your products with their assets
::: meta-data type="New" features="Collaboration, Productivity" available="late December" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO"

Collaborating around product data is now more efficient as it's now possible to export products and their associated assets from within the product grid or from your product export profiles. It will save you time whenever you need to share product information with your internal and external teams.

_How does it works?_ Once the export is completed, you receive an archive containing all the media linked to your products. In the downloaded Excel or CSV file, a new `file path` column allows you to know which assets are linked to which product.
