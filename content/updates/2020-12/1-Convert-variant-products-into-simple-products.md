# Convert variant products into simple products
::: meta-data type="New" features="Governance, Productivity" available="late December" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO"

To offer greater flexibility when dealing with variant products, you can now easily transform them into simple products directly from the PIM interface. What a big help whenever you need to refine your family variants! Or, in case some of your product ranges shrink to one product instead of multiples.

On a side note, this new feature will also help you change the family variants of your product model more efficiently. A real timer saver indeed.
