# Deliver your product quality scores to your other applications
::: meta-data type="New" features="Quality, Connectivity" available="early December" link-to-doc="TODO"

Are interested in sending your product quality score to third-party applications to compare this score to relevant metrics, such as the number of sales or the number of returns? Or maybe, you want to know, on your website, which products should be highlighted according to the quality of their enrichment level. Well, great news! It is now possible thanks to an evolution of our Rest API. 

Indeed, a new `quality_score` field is now available in our JSON product format when requesting products via the API. So you can now use and leverage this information in all the third-parties your PIM is connected to.
