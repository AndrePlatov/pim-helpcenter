# Cleaner attribute deletion
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Governance" available="mid-December"
:::

Whenever you delete an attribute, the PIM now launches a job to clean all its related attribute values. Neat!

We also provide a [documentation](../articles/TODO) to guide you if you want to keep those attribute values and link them to another newly created attribute. Pretty useful whenever you need to change whether an attribute should be localizable and/or scopable.
