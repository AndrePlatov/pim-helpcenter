# Easily measure your product quality
::: meta-data type="New" features="Quality" available="early December" link-to-doc="../articles/understand-data-quality.html#about-data-quality-insights"

Measuring your product quality has never been so easy thanks to our new simplified way to score your product: the **quality score**. This score replaces the enrichment and consistency grades for the sake of clarity.

You can now find this score next to the completeness in the header of each product page, as well as in the product grid. Don't hesitate to filter on it to focus on the products that need your attention due to their low-quality scoring.
