# Easily measure your product quality
::: meta-data type="New" features="Quality" available="early December" link-to-doc="../articles/understand-data-quality.html#about-data-quality-insights"

Measuring your product quality is now easier than ever thanks to the **quality score**, our new simplified way to score your product. It replaces the enrichment and consistency grades for an enhanced clarity.

You can now find this score next to the completeness in the header of each product page, as well as in the product grid. Don't hesitate to use it as a filter to focus your attention on the products with low-quality scoring.
