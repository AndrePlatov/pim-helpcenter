# Filter and export your product quality score
::: meta-data type="New" features="Quality, Collaboration" available="mid-February" link-to-doc="../articles/product-export-builder.html#use-the-quality-score-filters-for-product-export"

You can now export your product quality scores along with other product information directly in the Product Export Builder. Easily filter on the quality score(s) A, B, C, D, and/or E required to have the information in your exported Excel or CSV file.

This new feature can be very handy when:
- you want to only export high-quality products to distribute them to third-parties, 
- you want to find products with a low score to allow contributors to focus on enhancing this product information to increase their quality score.

You can also choose which locales you want this quality score filter to apply: to all your locales or only one.

By default, we do not export the quality score in product export profiles, so if you want to export your quality score on existing product exports, you need to edit them to add this filter.
