# Rules execution 4 times a day
::: meta-data type="New" features="Automation" available="mid-February" 

We now automatically execute rules 4 times a day: at 5 am UTC, at 11 am UTC, at 5 pm UTC, and at 11 pm UTC. This enhancement will help you faster your enrichment process. Indeed, your catalog is now more and more up-to-date with the latest computed values generated automatically by the Rules Engine.

Note that, of course, rules are still regularly executed after a bulk action or after imports with rules, and also, if you are allowed to, you can still execute one or several rules manually from the rule grid.
