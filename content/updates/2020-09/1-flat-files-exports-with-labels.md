# Export flat files with labels
::: meta-data type="New" features="Flat files exports" available="early September" link-to-doc="../articles/exports.html"
:::

For your return from the summer holidays, we decided to tackle a widely shared issue, the impossibility for humans to read your flat files exports.

Until then, it was nearly impossible for your clients to be able to decipher the codes into your product exports, and you had to re-work every file to be human-friendly.

So we decided to implement an improvement into:
* Quick export
* Export profile

Now, a new option named `Export with label` is available, helping you to display your product export with labels, translated into the selected locale (that must have been activated in your PIM).

This way, your product exports will have their headers and their values translated, making it easy to share to your clients.
# New UI for Quick Export
We also took the occasion to do a whole lifting for the quick export feature, with a fresh new UI. Let us know what you think about it :wink:
