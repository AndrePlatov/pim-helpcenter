# Export flat files with labels
::: meta-data type="New" features="Collaboration, Productivity" available="mid September" link-to-doc="../articles/exports.html"
:::

To save you time, it is now possible to export your product data in flat files with labels and without codes.
This improvement has been added to both existing features:
* Quick export
* Product export profile

You will notice an optional button named `With label`, helping you to export your product data with labels.
When activated, the **headers** (properties & attributes) and the **values** in your flat file will be displayed in the locale you will choose instead of displaying their codes.

For instance, if you have a multi-select attribute named "TS_STYLE032", it will be displayed as a label, "Tee-shirt style 032".
Same thing with the values of this attribute "T_NECK" and "L_SLEEVES" would be displayed a labels "Turtleneck" and "Long sleeves".


Please note that this improvement is optional, and if you choose to export with labels, you won't be able to import your file back into your PIM.
