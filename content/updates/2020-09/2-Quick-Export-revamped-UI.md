# Quick Export revamped UI
::: meta-data type="New" features="Collaboration, Productivity" available="mid September" link-to-doc="../articles/quick-export.html"
:::

Discover a brand new UI for the Quick Export feature!  
This new UI makes it more easy for you to select amongst the existing choices, especially as we added a new option named "With labels" (see announcement [here](2020-09.html#export-flat-files-with-labels)).

To save you time, the selections you've made are stored in your local session. It means the next time you will click on `Quick Export`, the same options will be already selected.

We hope you will enjoy it :wink:
