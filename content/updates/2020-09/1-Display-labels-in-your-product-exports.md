# Display labels instead of codes in your product exports
::: meta-data type="New" features="Collaboration, Productivity" available="mid-September" link-to-doc="../articles/exports.html#update-an-export-profile"
:::

To save time and improve the reading of exported files, we added an option in our XLSX and CSV export functionalities to display attribute labels instead of codes in the exported files. Under your product export profiles and also in the quick export, you now see a new button called `With labels`. If enabled, this button will allow you to export labels for your product data. You can choose to display **readable column's headers** instead of attribute and property codes. In the file's content, you can now display the **attribute values** in a chosen locale instead of their codes.

For instance, if you have a multi-select attribute named `TS_STYLE032`, it will be exported as a label, `Tee-shirt style 032`.
Same thing with the values of this attribute `T_NECK` and `L_SLEEVES` would be displayed as labels `Turtleneck` and `Long sleeves`.

If you prefer to stick with the previous format of the export files, no problem, simply keep the button disabled.
