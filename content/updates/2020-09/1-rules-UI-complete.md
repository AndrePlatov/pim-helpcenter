# The rules builder interface 100% complete!
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="late September" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#the-rule-builder-tab"
:::

You can now **entirely** create your rules from our PIM interface. Indeed, the rules builder has been updated with all the actions and conditions available to build a rule.

It means that you don't need to use your old YAML files anymore. You can very easily build and maintain all your rules directly from within this powerful interface.

Don't hesitate to try it and you'll see: it'll save you a tremendous amount of time.
