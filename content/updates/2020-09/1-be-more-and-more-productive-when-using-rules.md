# Be more and more productive when using rules

Two new improvements will help you be more and more productive when using the rules engine: you can now duplicate your rules and define a status for them!

## Quickly duplicate your rules

:::

In order to avoid re-writing the whole rule, you are now able to duplicate it in two clicks! Indeed, sometimes, you may have very similar rules with only one condition that is different, for instance. What a time saver, isn't it? :wink:

## Define a status for your rules
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="late September" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#define-a-status-for-a-rule"
:::

We introduced a new property for rules: an enabled/disabled status. This new status allows you to easily activate or deactivate your rules.  
For example, if the creation/edition of the rule is not finished yet, setting its status to "disabled" will pause the automatic execution of the rule.  
Once the rule is ready, you just have to enable it to let it be executed!
