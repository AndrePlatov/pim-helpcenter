# New improvements in 3.1

In 3.1, we improve the Franklin Insights to better manager your Franklin subscription.

## Filter on subscribed products in the product grid
This new filter makes it easier for marketers to identify which products are unsubscribed so that Julia can subscribe to them via a bulk action. The filter allows you to select All, Enabled (subscribed), and Disabled (unsubscribed).  
Prior to version 3.1 all products were displayed by default. This filter lets Julia narrow her list of products to manage in Franklin Insights.

The filter can also be added as a column to show the subscription status at a glance.

## Display family label in the attributes mapping screen
When subscribing to products in Franklin Insights and mapping attributes, it’s important to know what family is involved. In version 3.1, we’ve added the family label on the attribute mapping screen. Additionally, 3.1 now displays unmapped attributes first so that Julia can begin the attribute mapping processing without scrolling
