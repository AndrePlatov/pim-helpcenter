# New improvements in 3.2

We continue improving the feature in 3.2.

## Exact match attribute mapping
New in Franklin Insights is the ability to automatically map attributes where the fields are an exact match in Franklin and in the PIM catalog. This new capability reduces the need to do manual mapping only for fields where the attribute names are different.

## Suggest attributes for a family
If Franklin finds an attribute that exists but is in a different family, a button appears that enables you to simply add the attribute to the current family, which reduces clicks and streamlines the mapping process.

## Suggest creating new attributes
If Franklin finds an attribute that does not exist in the PIM, a new `Create attribute` button appears so that in a single action, you can create the attribute and attach it to the family, without having to exit the attribute mapping screen.

## Work in progress
New in version 3.2 is a progress bar that shows the number of attributes matched compared to how many are remaining to do. This offers an at-a-glance view of the remaining mapping work left to perform.

## Faster proposals generation
In 3.2, the time to generate a proposal from Franklin Insights has been changed from once per hour to once every 5 minutes, making this process 12 times faster.
