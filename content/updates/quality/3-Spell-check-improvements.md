To help reach a higher data quality content yet, **spell-check and suggestions are now available on text area attributes with rich text editor enabled** (WYSIWYG).

## On attribute and option labels

You can now benefit from spell-checking on attributes and option labels to guarantee the consistency on your customer-facing product data.

You can now check and correct spelling mistakes in attributes in the `Settings` pages.  
This improvement is also available in the product form. New recommendations are listed, should we find errors. The better the content, the higher the quality score! :wink:
