Measuring your product quality is now easier than ever thanks to the **quality score**, our new simplified way to score your product. It replaces the enrichment and consistency grades for an enhanced clarity.

You can now find this score next to the completeness in the header of each product page, as well as in the product grid. Don't hesitate to use it as a filter to focus your attention on the products with low-quality scoring.

## ...All your products...

You'll also notice that this score and the Data Quality Insights tab are now available for both your variant products and product models! Get specific quality scores for all your product variants and quickly identify the list of attributes you need to improve for a specific variant product. We also deliver a quality score at the product model level in which you will see at a glance on which level the attribute to improved is (product variant or model level).

To enhance your productivity, you can also notice that, under the Data Quality Insights tab, if you have any improvement recommendations, you can simply click on your attribute to directly access it and improve it!

You can now fine-tune which product attributes you want to count in your quality score, by enabling/disabling the feature at the attribute group level. You can toggle this under the attribute group setting page. ðŸ˜‰

This option comes with a dedicated permission. So don't hesitate to ask your PIM admin to give you the right to enable/disable the feature.
