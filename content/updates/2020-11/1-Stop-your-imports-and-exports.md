# Stop your imports and exports
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-November" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

A brand new `Stop` button is now displayed in your process tracker. It enables you to stop the Excel and CSV imports/exports you launched. Super helpful whenever you launch a job by mistake and don't want to wait for it to execute until the end. ðŸ˜‰

This button comes with a dedicated permission `Stop an ongoing job`. If you need it, ask your PIM admin to give you the right to do so.

On a side note, some other jobs such as mass actions or rule executions can also be stopped at any time in the process tracker. So neat!
