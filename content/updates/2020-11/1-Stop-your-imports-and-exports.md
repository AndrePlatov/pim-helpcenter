# Easily stop ongoing jobs
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-November" link-to-doc="../articles/TODO.html"
:::

A brand new `Stop` button is now displayed in your process tracker. It enables you to stop jobs: imports, exports but also ongoing mass actions or rule executions. Super helpful whenever you launch a job by mistake (we're all humans after all) and don't want to wait for it to execute until the end. ðŸ˜‰

This button comes with a dedicated permission `Stop an ongoing job`. If you need it, ask your PIM admin to give you the right to do so.
