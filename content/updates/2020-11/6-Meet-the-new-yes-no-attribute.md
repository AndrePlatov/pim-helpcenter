# Meet the new Yes/No attribute

You can discover a brand new Yes/No attribute in your product form. It allows you to better see when your Yes/No value has not been set yet. In addition to this improvement, new filters are available when searching on the Yes/No attribute, whenever its value is empty... ...or not.

## New Yes/No attribute in the product form
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late November"

The Yes/No attribute is now more powerful: you can easily see if your Yes/No attribute has no value yet. Pretty convenient and way less misleading than before!

## Better filter with the Yes/No attribute
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late November"

Two new operators are now available when filtering on Yes/No attributes in your product grid and rules engine: `is empty` and `is not empty`. Those new filters help you gain in productivity and be even more efficient when looking for specific products and product models.

![New is empty and is not empty filters on the Yes/No attributes](../img/is-empty-is-not-empty-filters.png)

The first one, `is empty`, allows you to search for products and product models that have Yes/No attribute with no value selected. The second one, `is not empty` allows you to search for the contrary.
