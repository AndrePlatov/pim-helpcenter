# Meet the new Yes/No attribute

Discover our revamped Yes/No attribute in your product forms. This new display allows you to better see when your Yes/No attribute does not yet have a defined value. In addition to this improvement, we added new filters to ease the search on Yes/No attributes.

## New Yes/No attribute in the product form
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late November"

The Yes/No attribute is now more user-friendly: you can easily see if your Yes/No attribute has no value yet. You can also empty it if needed.

## Better filter with the Yes/No attribute
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="late November"

Two new operators `is empty` and `is not empty` are now available to help you filter on Yes/No attributes in the product grid and to automate enrichment with the rules engine. These new filters help you gain in productivity and be even more efficient when looking for specific products and product models.

![New is empty and is not empty filters on the Yes/No attributes](../img/is-empty-is-not-empty-filters.png)

The first one, `is empty`, allows you to find products and product models that have no value for a specific Yes/No attribute. The second one, `is not empty`, allows you to search for the opposite.
