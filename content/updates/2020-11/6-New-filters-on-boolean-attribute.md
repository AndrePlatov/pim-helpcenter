::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="late November"

Two new operators are now available when filtering on boolean attributes in your product grid and rules engine: `is empty` and `is not empty`. Those new filters we help you gain in productivity and be even more efficient when looking for specific products and product models.

The first one, `is empty`, allows you to search for products and product models with boolean attribute has no value is selected. The seconde one, `is not empty` allows you to search for the contrary.
