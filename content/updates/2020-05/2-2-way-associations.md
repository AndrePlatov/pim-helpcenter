We created a new association type named **2-way association**. You can find it in `Settings` then `Association types`.

When associating some products to others, you now have the possibility to link them via a two-way association.
Example: if you associate product A to product B, product B will be **automatically** associated to product A.

This feature is especially useful for clients who need to display which products are compatible with which other products (like machines and spare parts).
