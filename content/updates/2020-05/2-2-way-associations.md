We created a new association type named **2-way association**. You can find it in `Settings` then `Association types`.

When associating some products with others, you now have the possibility to link them thanks to a two-way association.
Example: if you associate product A to product B, product B will **automatically** be associated with product A.

This feature is particularly useful for clients who need to display products that are compatible with other products (like machines and spare parts).
