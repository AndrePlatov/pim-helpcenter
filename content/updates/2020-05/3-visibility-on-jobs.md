Say welcome to a brand new permission called `View all jobs in the Process Tracker`! It will allow you to see all jobs in the Process Tracker, even the ones that you didn't launch. Really neat if you are an admin and need to have a quick overview of what's running in the PIM. :wink:

The previous `View Process Tracker` permission still exists and can now be combined with this new permission.
