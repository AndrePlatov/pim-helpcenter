In the quick export and your product Excel and CSV export profile, you can now enable a new `With labels` option. It will allow you to export product data labels (e.g. attribute labels and values, etc.) instead of their code. With an increased readability, it is pretty useful if you plan to share this file to colleagues or external contributors.

Note that you can even choose the locale of the labels.

If you prefer to stick to the previous format of the export files, no problem, simply leave the button disabled.
