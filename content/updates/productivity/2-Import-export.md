Having a hard time initializing the records of your reference entities? We got you covered! You can now import an Excel or CSV file containing your records. We also make it possible for you to export them in Excel or CSV, once enriched. So neat!

You can find this new feature in the `Import` and `Export` menus, under the following job names: 
- `Reference entity record import in XSLX`,
- `Reference entity record import in CSV`,
- `Reference entity record export in XLSX`,
- `Reference entity record export in CSV`.

This new feature can also help you bulk update your records or easily duplicate them.

## Export your products with their assets
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/exports.html#update-an-export-profile"

It's now possible to export products and their associated assets from the product grid or your product export profiles. Collaboration around product data is more efficient and it will save you time whenever you need to share product information with your internal and external teams.

To do so, you can use our new `With media` option when doing a quick export or using your favorite product export profile. Note, that by default, this option is not enabled.

## Import assets with Excel or CSV files
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="true" link-to-doc="../articles/import-assets.html"

To save you a tremendous amount of time, it is now possible to mass import assets via Excel or CSV files containing all your asset values. Indeed, in our `Import` menu, you can now discover a brand new import profile dedicated to this task. 

Note that this feature is only available for assets with media file as main media.

## Display labels instead of codes in your product exports

In the quick export and your product Excel and CSV export profile, you can now enable a new `With labels` option. It will allow you to export product data labels (e.g. attribute labels and values, etc.) instead of their code. With an increased readability, it is pretty useful if you plan to share this file to colleagues or external contributors.

Note that you can even choose the locale of the labels.

If you prefer to stick to the previous format of the export files, no problem, simply leave the button disabled.
