# Manual execution of asset naming conventions

:::

You can now manually execute asset naming conventions from the user interface whenever you need it. This new feature can be very useful if your naming convention has changed after assets were uploaded or created.

Asset naming conventions populate asset attributes with values contained in the asset filename or asset code. Prior to this improvement, naming conventions were executed once, when the asset was created.

There are two ways to manually execute a naming convention:
- for one specific asset, directly in the asset edit form. The action is visible under the `...` in the top right corner.
- for an asset family, under the `Product link rules` tab of your asset family. The naming convention will be applied to all the assets belonging to this family.
