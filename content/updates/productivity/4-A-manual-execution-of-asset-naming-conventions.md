You can now manually execute asset naming conventions from the user interface whenever you need it. This new feature can be very useful if your naming convention has changed after asset uploads or creations.

Asset naming conventions populate asset attributes with values contained in the asset filename or asset code. Prior to this improvement, naming conventions were executed once at the asset creation step.

There are two ways to manually execute a naming convention:
- for one specific asset, directly in the asset edit form. The action is visible under the `...`.

- for an asset family, under the `Product link rules` tab of your asset family. The naming convention will be applied to all the assets belonging to this family.
