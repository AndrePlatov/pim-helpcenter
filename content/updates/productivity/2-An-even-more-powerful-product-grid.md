# Even more powerful product grid

## Private views
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false"

Stay organized in your product enrichment thanks to private views! From now on, when you create a view, you can make it private to keep it to yourself, for your personal work organization, or public to share it with other PIM users. This improvement will help you to focus on your own enrichment needs without confusing your teammates.

## Variant display option
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#display-products-with-variants"
:::

The product grid also benefits from a new `Variant` display option above the grid. Use it if you want to see your variant products individually in the grid, or keep them grouped by product models. Thanks to this new option, you no longer need to click on a product model to access its variants. What a time saver!

## Product typology grid filter
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-product-typology"
:::

The new `Product typology` filter in the product grid allows you to choose to display only the simple products or only the variant products (or only their product models if you group your variants).

## Search by product model identifier
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-the-identifier"
:::

In your product grid, you can now search by product model (and sub-product model) identifiers. Enter your product model ID in our search bar or in the `Identifier` filter et voil√†!

## Products and product models counters
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"
:::

The product grid counter at the top of the page is also revamped to be easier to understand. We now show you the number of products and the number of product models. Crystal clear!
