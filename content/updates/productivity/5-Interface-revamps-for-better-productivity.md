# Interface improvements for better productivity

The attribute options screen for single and multiple-select attributes has been completely redesigned to give you a better user experience.

Navigate more easily between your option codes and their translations, and manage your attribute options more efficiently!

The management page was also revamped to increase its usability.

To finish, we also redesigned the login page, our flash messages, and the quick export screen, as you can see below.

To help you save time, the custom choices you make for your XLSX or CSV quick export are saved. So next time you click on `Quick export`, the last export configuration will be displayed. :rocket:
