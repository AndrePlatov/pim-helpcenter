# Interface improvements for better productivity

The attribute option screen for single and multi-select attributes has been completely redesigned to give you a better user experience.

Navigate more easily between your option codes and their translations, and manage your attribute options more efficiently!

The locale management page was also revamped to increase its usability.

To finish, we also redesigned our flash messages, the quick export screen, and the login page, as you can see below.
