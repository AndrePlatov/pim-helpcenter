# More helpful process tracker

## See all ongoing jobs
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"
:::

To give you more visibility and control over all the PIM jobs, we added a new permission: `View all jobs in the process tracker`. This permission allows you to see all jobs, regardless of who runs them or what their status is in the process tracker.


## Easily stop ongoing jobs
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/monitor-jobs.html#how-to-stop-your-jobs"
:::

A brand new `Stop` button is now displayed in your process tracker. It enables you to stop jobs: imports, exports but also ongoing mass actions or rule executions. Super helpful whenever you launch a job by mistake (we're only humans after all) and don't want to wait for it to run until the end. ðŸ˜‰

This button comes with a dedicated permission `Stop an ongoing job`. If you need it, ask your PIM admin to give you access.

## Monitor ongoing jobs progress and time left
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/monitor-jobs.html#what-can-you-find-in-a-job-detail"
:::

Whenever you launch a job, a progress bar and an estimation of the remaining time before the job is completed, are now displayed in the process tracker. You can now easily see how long it will take to process a job, to help you better organize your daily tasks.

## Easily access to the detail of your quick export once launched
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"
:::

When you launch a quick product export from the product grid, you can now easily jump to this task's progress detail in the process tracker. Indeed, you'll find a link to the job detail embedded in the flash message that confirms the quick export launch.

## Process tracker display enhancements
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/monitor-jobs.html#searching-for-a-job"
:::

Quickly find a launched job thanks to the new `User` filter that we introduce in the process tracker grid. It allows you to easily find either your own jobs or those started by one of your colleagues. Neat!

Additionally, you are also able to sort the process tracker grid jobs by users.
