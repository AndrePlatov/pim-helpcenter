# An even more powerful product grid

## Duplicate your products
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/duplicate-a-product.html"
:::

To easily create a new product based on an existing one, you can now use our duplicate feature to copy a product in your user interface in one single click!

Find this new action under the `...` button in the top right corner of each of your product edit forms.

This new feature also comes with dedicated permission, so you can decide which group(s) of users can perform this action.

## Create private views
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-views.html#create-a-view"

Stay organized in your product enrichment thanks to private views! From now on, when you create a view, you can make it private to keep it for yourself and have it only visible by you, or public to share it with other PIM users. This improvement will help you to focus on your own enrichment needs without confusing your teammates.

## Switch between simple and variant product displays
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-product-typology"
:::

The new `Product typology` filter in the product grid allows you to choose to display only the simple products or only the variant products (or only their product models if you group your variants).

## Switch between variant product and product model displays
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#display-products-with-variants"
:::

The product grid also benefits from a new `Variant` display option above the grid. Use it if you want to see your variant products individually in the grid, or keep them grouped by product models. Thanks to this new option, you no longer need to click on a product model to access its variants. What a time saver!

## Search product models using their identifier
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/enrich-products-variants.html#filter-on-the-identifier"
:::

In your product grid, you can now search by product model (and sub-product model) identifiers. Enter your product model ID in our search bar or in the `Identifier` filter et voil√†!

## Products and product models counters
::: meta-data type="Improvement" ee-only="false"
:::

The product grid counter at the top of the page is also revamped to be more intelligible. We now show you the number of products and the number of product models. Crystal clear!
