# Enhanced connection monitoring

## Monitor errors on your connections 
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="../articles/connection-dashboard.html#in-the-connection-monitoring-page"
:::

For each of your connections, a new `Monitoring` page now lists the latest integration errors that may have occurred.

From this page, you can now easily track and fix any data error on product creation, update, or deletion for each of your connections.

Each warning message shows:
- a small paragraph that explains what went wrong during the connection's synchronization, 
- internal links to help you check the data in your PIM,
- external links to directly access useful information in our help center.

We also enhanced the Connection dashboard with additional information. To ease error monitoring and allow you to see at a glance how your source connections are performing, the Connection dashboard now displays: 
- a graph with the number of product errors (business and technical) for the past week,

- connection cards showing the number of business errors for the past week.

## Track your destination connections

You can now easily track the number of products that were sent to your destinations in the Connection dashboard.

You can consult this metric for each of the last 7 days. We also compute the sum of the last 7 days.

By default, new connections won't be monitored. If you want to activate their tracking, check the dedicated option in the Connection setting page.

You now have more control over the connections you want to track in the Connection Dashboard!
