# Accelerate your connections with the Events API
::: meta-data type="New" ee-only="false" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/events-documentation/introduction.html"

You know how crucial it is to efficiently connect your PIM to third-party applications such as your ERP, eCommerce platform, or DAM. To help you ramp up on this topic, we're launching a brand new API, called the `Events API`.

Together with our [existing REST API](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/introduction.html), the Events API offers a complementary way to synchronize your PIM data with third-party applications. By reducing synchronization delays, it will accelerate the access and distribution of your product information.

This new feature can be enabled in the new tab named `Event subscription` for each connection. Don't hesitate to try it out; we're eager to hear your feedback!
