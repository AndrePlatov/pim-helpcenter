# Manage user groups

A user group in Akeneo PIM is a way to manage sets of users. Users can belong to multiple groups. Groups are used in the PIM to define the access rights and the visibility to the product catalog.


> **Note**
  Roles are similar to groups, they also enable and define rights on the product catalog. The main difference is that the roles entitle rights on what the user is allowed to do in the PIM (to sum up, access to all the existing buttons and menus in the PIM).


## View the user groups list

**To see which groups have been created:**

1.  Log in with a user account witch has the rights to see the groups (system: List of user).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Groups

## To edit the users associated to a group:

1.  A grid of users is displayed with the users belonging to the respective group. They can be easily identified by the check box in the first column “has group”.
1.  Look for the users and check the box to add the users to the group. And the other way around, uncheck the box to withdraw the users from the group.
1.  Then click on the “Save” button to update the group.

The rights which have been granted to or removed from users (added to or removed from the user group) are automatically applied. The user can still continue to be connected to the PIM: the change on rights will be updated on the next loading of a page in the PIM.

## Delete a group of users

Before deleting a group, you should check first if the specific group is used to entitle access rights to other users.

**To delete a user group:**

1.  Log in with a user account with the rights to edit a group (permission System > Remove a user group).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Groups
1.  You have two ways to proceed:
    *   Click on the user group to be deleted and click on the “delete” button on the top right.
    *   Click on the “delete” button straight away from the grid dragging the mouse on the group you want to delete.
1.  Then confirm the message for the suppression of the group.

Please check first the potential impact of the removal of a group on which users are included. For instance, if the group membership was the only way for a user to have a specific right, then due to the group suppression, the user will have no longer his access right in the PIM.
