In the latest versions, we have added an information page that contains technical information. To check this page, go to System/System Information.

On this page, you will have a sum up of all technical information that could be very helpful when raising a ticket: Edition version, Storage, Environment, Activated bundles… Once you land on this page, click on “TXT” button on the right hand corner to download a text file containing all this information.

This page has been developed in order to gather most of the information you need to raise tickets through our Helpdesk. Please attach the text file downloaded to your ticket (Attachment field).
