### A user

A user is an account access to log into the PIM, it can be used by one or several persons in a company. A user has at least one login, one password, one email and a role.

### A role

A role is a set of permissions in the PIM. A role may be assigned to one or several users.

### A permission

A permission is a right to see menus, edit products or execute a job for instance. Permissions are cumulative: the rights the most permissive are applied.
You have two kind of permissions in the PIM: the role’s permissions for both versions (Community and Enterprise) and the advanced permissions that are only available for Enterprise Edition clients, that allow you to define specific rights on locales, attribute groups and categories.

### A user group

A user group is a set of users grouped by a name. A user may be a part of several user groups. For example, the user group “Marketing Dpt” gathers all the users in the Marketing Department of the company. The user group “Managers” gathers all the users who are manager of a department. Some users can be in the “Marketing Dpt” only.

Advanced permissions can be applied on user groups in the Enterprise Edition. In the Community Edition, there is no permission applied on user groups.
