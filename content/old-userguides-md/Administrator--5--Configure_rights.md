## Configure roles

A role in Akeneo PIM is a way to manage a set of users. Users can be part of a multiple roles. Roles are used to define actions and view rights.

### See the roles

**To view the roles:**

1.  Log in with a user account having the rights to see the roles (System: List roles).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Roles.
1.  To view the settings of a role, click on it:

    ![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)

    A page will be displayed, go under the Permissions tab to check or edit the role’s permissions.

    You can grant or revoke all entity’s permissions at once, by clicking on its name.

    If a role has all permissions granted for a specific entity, a green checkbox will be visible in front of it.

    If all permissions are revoked, a red cross will be visible.

    Finally, a light grey circle indicates that the role has partial permissions on the entity.

### Create a role

**To create a new role:**

1.  Log in with a user account having the rights to create a role (System: Create a role)
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Roles,
1.  Click on “Create role” button, fill in the form and give a name to the role,
![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)
1.  Click on “Save” to add the new role,
1.  Then select the permissions for the role and select users.

### Edit a role’s name

**To edit the name of a role:**

1.  Log in with a user account having rights to edit a role (System: Edit Role).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Roles.
1.  Click on the role you want to modify.
1.  Change its name.
1.  Click on “Save” to update the role.


> **Note**
  A role’s name cannot be longer than 25 characters.


### Change a user’s role

**To edit a user’s role:**

1.  Log in with a user account having rights to edit a role (System: Edit Role).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Roles.
1.  Click on the role to edit and go under the “Users” tab
![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)
1.  The list of users is displayed. Users currently belonging to the role can be easily identified by the check box in the first column “has role”.
1.  Look for the users and check boxes to add users to the role. And the other way around, uncheck the boxes for users to be removed from the role.
1.  Click on “Save” button to update the role.

The rights which have been granted to or removed from users are automatically applied. Changes on rights will be updated on the next PIM page’s loading.

### Delete a role

Before deleting a role, you should check if this role is currently assigned to some users.

**To delete a role:**

1.  Log in with a user account having rights to edit a role (System: Remove a role).
1.  Go to System/Users Management/Roles.
1.  You have two ways to proceed:
    *   Click on the role to remove and click on the “Delete” button on the top right corner.
    *   Or click on the “Delete” trash icon directly from the grid dragging the mouse on the role you want
        to delete.
1.  Then confirm the suppression of the role.

    Please check first the potential impact of the removal of a role on which users have been associated to. For instance, if the role job was the only way for the user to have a specific right, then due to the role suppression, the user will have no longer his access right in the PIM.

## Configure rights on a product catalog (Enterprise Edition only)

### Access rights on assets

Access rights enable you to configure the scope of role and visibility of users on assets in the PIM. The scope of role and visibility is set on one axis:

*   It is possible to define for each user, which assets can be viewed and/or edited, depending on the classification of the assets in the categories.

### Set levels of asset access rights according to categories

**Setting the level of access on assets according to Categories:**

1.  Go to Enrich/Asset Categories
1.  Select the category to set permissions on in the left panel.
1.  Click on “Permissions” tab
1.  Click in the fields and select groups to grant them permissions.
1.  Click on “Save” button.
1.  Permissions are immediately applied to users.

By default, all users are entitled to all the rights on the created categories through the group “All”. If you define permissions to specific groups, remove the “All” group.

If an asset is in multiple categories of one tree or more and if the user has at least a view permission to one of the asset’s category, the user will be able to see the asset.

**Option “Apply changes on children”**

Changes made on the permissions are listed at the bottom of the “Permissions” form in the «Changes» section.

Below the list, there is an option to “apply changes on children”. This option is checked by default and can apply to all sub-categories of the edited category.

![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)

In the example above, all sub-categories will have no longer the “All” group in any of the permission category, but they will keep their own configurations.

### Access rights to product information (Enterprise Edition only)

Access rights enable you to configure the scope of role and visibility of users to the product catalog in the PIM.

**You can define access rights on 3 axes:**

*   Locales: if a product catalog is available in several locales, it is possible to define for each user which local can be viewed and/or edited.
*   Categories: If a product catalog uses the classification tree in the PIM, it is possible to define for each user, which products can be viewed and/or edited, depending on the classification of products in the different categories.
*   Attribute groups: if a product catalog uses the attribute group in the PIM system, it is possible to define for each user, which attributes can be viewed and/or edited, depending on the attribute group in which they are positioned.

### Hierarchy of access rights for product information (Enterprise Edition only)

**For each axis there are 3 levels of access:**

*   Permission to edit information
*   Permission to view information
*   No rights: the information is hidden to the user

As rights are subject to 3 axes, hierarchy prevents any conflicts defining permissions for each user. The axes of the hierarchy is the following:

*  Locale
    *   Category
        *   Attributes Group

How to apply the rule of hierarchy? It requires at least one access right to view on the parent axis to apply the rule to the child axis.

You will find below a couple of examples to illustrate how the rule of hierarchy applies to each user:

**A user has been granted with the following rights:**

*  Locale “deDE”: no right

Category “Shoes”: view & edit permissions

Attributes Group “General”: view & edit permissions

This user will never see the products in the category Shoes, nor edit the attributes in the “General” group in the “deDE” locale because the user does not have access on this locale, and he will never be able to see it.

**Let’s give the same user the permission to view the locale “enUS”:**

*  Locale “deDE”: no rights & Locale “enUS”: view permission

Category “Shoes”: view permission

Attributes Group “General”: view & edit permissions

The user can see the products in the category “Shoes” and can see the attributes in the “General” group in the “enUS” locale, but cannot edit them because he has only a view permission for “enUS” locale.

**Let’s give the same user the permission to edit the locale “frFR”, you will see:**

*  Locale “deDE”: no rights & Locale “enUS”: view permission & Locale “frFR”: edit permission

Category “Shoes”: view & edit permissions

Group of attributes “General”: view & edit permissions

On the “frFR” locale, the user can edit the products in the category Shoes and can edit the attributes in the “General” group. He can only see products and their attributes in “enUS” locale and he can’t see “deDE” product’s information.

The hierarchy is thus applied to each individual axis of the rules.

### Define the level of access to products according to locales

**Set the level of access to products according to locales**

1.  Go to Settings/Locales.
1.  Select the locale from the grid or using the grid’s filters.
1.  Click on the “Permissions” tab from the menu.
1.  Click in the fields to add user’s groups to grant them permisssions.
1.  Click on “Save”
1.  Permissions are immediately applied to users.

**If a user has rights to edit product information for a specific locale:**

*   The specific locale will be displayed in the drop down menu for the available locales
  *   In the product grid
  *   In the published product grid (Enterprise Edition only)
  *   In the product edit form
  *   When translating product information (product edit form)
  *   In the variant groups edit form

**If a user has no rights to see nor edit product information for a specific locale:**

*   This locale will not be displayed in the drop down menu of available locales
  *   In the product grid
  *   In the published product grid
  *   In the publishing product form,
  *   To translate product information (edit product form).

### Set the level of access rights to products according to categories

**Set the level of access to the products according to Categorie:**

1.  Go to Enrich/Categories
1.  Select the category to set permissions on
1.  Go under the “Permissions” tab
1.  Click in the fields to add user’s groups to grant them permisssions.

  ![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)

1.  Click on “Save”
1.  Permissions are immediately applied to users.

    By default, all users are entitled to all rights on the created categories through the group “All”. If you define specific permissions for user groups, please remove the “All” group.

If a product is classified in multiple categories of one or more trees and if a user has at least a view permission to its categories, he will be able to see the product.

**Option “Apply changes on children”**

Changes made on the permissions are listed at the bottom of the “Permissions” form in the «Changes» section.

Below the list, there is an option to “apply changes on children”. This option is checked by default and can apply to all sub-categories of the edited category.

![image](../img/Akn_dashboard.jpg)

In the example above, all sub-categories will no longer have the “All” group in any of the permission set the category, but they will keep their own configurations.

**Specific rights on categories: ownership & classification as multi-products**

An additional right is available for categories, it’s the “Ownership” permission.

This right allows to define for each user, who is responsible for product information according to the product classification in the different categories. For more information on the user role’s scope with the “Ownership” permission, please refer to the user guide.

A product can be classified into several categories. The most permissive rights are then applied to the product. For instance, a product is classified in 3 different categories: a first category for which the user has no rights, a second category for which the user is entitled to see the products, and a third category for which the user is entitled to edit products. Thus the user has the edit permission on the product.

The allocation of rights impacts the user behavior and what is displayed when connecting to the PIM. Below, you will find the description of the possible impacts for each right:

**Be responsible for product information in a category**

When you have the ownership permissions, you can:

*   Edit the product information directly; rather than going through the proposal’s workflow,
*   View/review the current proposals of product values,
*   Approve/reject or partially approve proposals of values that needs to be reviewed
*   Publish/unpublish a product version

**Publish product information in a category**
