# Overview

This feature allows you to provide your product information to third-parties like e-commerce platforms, mobile applications, suppliers... or for other needs.

You have several ways to export your product information:
- You can manually download the export file: you execute the job from the PIM user interface and you download the generated file.
- You automatically send the export file to the third-party, by setting a path in the export profile configuration enabling the PIM to automatically drop the file when executing the command.

When exporting the products, Akeneo PIM extracts data from the PIM and converts it to push in a certain format to a file or directly to a third party application (eg Magento ).

# What is a export profile?

An export profile allows to perform exports in or from the PIM. This profile format is based on:
- A code to identify the export or export profile.
- A job with a connector to define what will make the export when executing. For instance, a product export in CSV or XLSX file, category export in CSV or XLSX to a Magento platform.
- A set of configuration fields, available as a form in the PIM. Each job can have its own configuration. Thus the job configuration form “product export” in CSV connector in Akeneo will be different from the job configuration form “product export” in XLSX or from any customised job created.

    The list of jobs matches all the jobs available to perform exports, for all installed and configured connectors with Akeneo PIM.
1.  Click on “Save” to finalise the profile’s creation. The profile page screen is displayed. It is then possible to configure the job export.

# Modify an export profile

If a user has no rights granted to modify an export or export profile due to his role, then the permissions which he may benefit due to his group (Enterprise Edition rights) will not be applied. For instance, if a user does not have the “edit profiles of exports” permission, his Enterprise Edition rights to edit a specific export profile is ignored.

To edit an export profile
1.  Connect with a user account with edit permission for an export profile.
1.  Go to the Spread/Export Profiles.
1.  Click on the Export profile that needs to be modified.
1.  Click on “Edit”, go under the tab “General properties”. The code and label properties are available for all export profiles, the Global Settings properties depend of the export job. For example for the CSV product export:

You will find the following properties:

| Property            | Details   |
|:--------------------|:----------|
| Decimal separator  | Defines the character used as decimal separator in the exported |
| Date format        | Defines the format used for dates in the exported file |
| File path       | Defines the path for the CSV file generated by the export |
| Delimiter     | Defines the character to delimit the fields in the CSV file |
| Enclosure   | Defines the character for the field enclosure in the CSV file |
| With header             | Defines if the first line of the exported file contains the columns names     |
| Export files and images | Disable the media archiving of images, images will not be exported in the file and the image column will not be present in the export. |

You can change the export configuration under the export profile management. Please refer to the Akeneo PIM administration guidelines to do so.

To learn more about connectors and how they work, please refer to the relevant documentation. For instance, for more information about the CSV connector, refer to the documentation of the Akeneo connector Akeneo to export CSV files or XLSX files.

1.  Select the job profile to execute, and click on the relevant line.
1.  The export profile page is displayed. Click on the “Export” button.
