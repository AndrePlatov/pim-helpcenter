You would like to migrate to our new 4.0 version and you are using the PAM to manage your digital assets?
You have to know that the PAM disappeared in 4.0, and we replaced it with our brand new asset manager!

But don't worry this step-by-step migration guide is made for you! It explains in details how you can migrate your PAM assets to our new 4.0 Asset Manager.

::: warning
Before migrating your PAM assets, the first step is to migrate your PIM in 4.0.

If you want to know the main differences and changes between the PAM and the new Asset Manager features, we strongly recommend you to read this article [From PAM to new Asset Manager](from-PAM-to-new-AM.html) before.

# "Migrate the PAM assets": what does it mean?
Migrating the PAM assets means that the following assets information will be migrated from your existing PAM to the new 4.0 Asset Manager:
- For each asset, itsÂ **asset properties** (code, description, tags, end of use at)
- For each asset, its **asset reference files** / binaries (if the asset is localizable, one reference file per locale)
- For each asset, its **asset variations files** / binaries (one variation file per channel for each reference file)
And for each asset, its **links to products and products models** (the `assets collection` product attributes values) will be kept.

# How can I migrate my PAM assets?
Your PIM is in 4.0 and you want to migrate your PAM assets?

To fit all your needs and use cases, we provide 3 ways to migrate your PAM assets:
1. A [full-automatic migration](full-automatic-pam-migration.html)
2. A [family-by-family migration](family-by-family-pam-migration.html).
3. A full-manual migration

These 3 migration ways are using a dedicated tool [CSVToAsset](https://github.com/akeneo/CsvToAsset) that we built.

## 1-The full-automatic migration
In this migration, **everything is automated**, you just need to launch one single command and your PAM assets will be migrated in the 4.0 new Asset Manager:
- One asset family will be created gathering all your assets.
- All your assets will be migrated and linked to the new asset family.
- All your existing PAM `assets collection` product attributes will be linked to the new asset family.
- And all your links between assets and products / product models will be kept.

If you want to try this migration, please follow this step-by-step [full-automatic migration guide](full-automatic-pam-migration.html) guide.

## 2-The family-by-family migration
In this migration, you can have **several asset families** for your existing PAM assets.

You will need to manually define 2 things:
- For each asset, its asset family.
- For each new `asset collection` product attribute, the linked asset family.

Other steps are automated, you just need to launch few commands and your PAM assets will be migrated in the 4.0 new Asset Manager:
- The asset families will be created automatically in the PIM.
- All your assets will be migrated and linked to the asset family you defined.
- All you existing PAM asset collection product attributes will be linked to the asset family.
- And all your links between assets and products / product models will be kept.

You want to try this migration, please follow the step-by-step [family-by-family migration guide](family-by-family-pam-migration.html) guide.

## 3-The full-manual migration
In this migration, you will model in the PIM all the asset families you want with their attributes.

# Which migration do we advise you to choose?
First, if you want to go fast in this migration, you can use the [full-automatic migration](full-automatic-pam-migration.html) to test if it fits your needs.

If you have more than 1 old `assets collection` product attribute and if these attributes are already split by asset family (for example, an asset collection for Images, an asset collection for Notices...), we recommend you the [family-by-family migration](family-by-family-pam-migration.html).

# What are the limits?
## No change on assets links to products
In these 3 migration strategies, the assets links to the products are automatically migrated and cannot be modified.

It means that you can't modify the asset links to products and the number of `asset collection` product attributes.

**Why?** Because links to products are vital and we would like to keep the existing asset/product links. Thus, we don't want to impact your sales channels with this migration.

 <!--TODO
If you really want to change your asset collection product attribute, you need to do it manually by exporting the products, splitting...
But be careful...-->

# What about my connectors?
**Your connectors that previously import or export your PAM assets need to be updated to fit with our 4.0 new Asset Manager**.

New API endpoints are available and explained on our [API documentation of the Asset Manager](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/asset-manager.html).
