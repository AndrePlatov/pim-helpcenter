You would like to migrate on our new 4.0 version and you are using the PAM to manage your digital assets, the PAM disappeared in 4.0, we replaced it by our brand new asset manager! But don't worry this guide is for you! It explains how your PAM assets can be migrated to our new 4.0 Asset Manager.

First, if you wan't to know, the main differences and changes between the PAM and the new Asset Manager in 4.0, we strongly recommend to read this article [From PAM to new Asset Manager](from-PAM-to-new-AM.html) before.

# Migrate the PAM assets what does it mean?
It means that the following assets information will be migrated from your existing PAM to the new 4.0 Asset Manager:
- The **asset properties** (code, description, tags, end of use at)
- The **asset reference files** (reference file / binary)
- The **asset transformations files** (variations / binaries)
- The **asset links to products and products models**

# How can I migrate my PAM assets?
To fit all your needs and use cases, we provide 3 ways to migrate your PAM assets:
1. A full-automatic migration
2. A family-by-family migration
3. A full-manual migration

## The full-automatic migration
In this migration, everything is automated, you just need to launch few commands and your PAM assets will be migrated in the 4.0 new Asset Manager.
On asset family "PAM assets" will be created gathering all you assets.
All your assets will be migrated and linked to the asset family "PAM assets".
All you existing product asset collection attributes will be linked to the asset family "PAM assets".
And all your links between assets and products / product model will be kept.

You want to try this migration, please follow the step-by-step [full-automatic migration guide](full-automatic-migration-pam.html).
