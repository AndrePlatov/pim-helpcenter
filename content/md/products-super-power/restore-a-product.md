# Introduction to the restore feature

Just picture the following case: you have a published product, which information is disseminated in different channels. You are currently enriching the product forms: new photos, more detailed description, new price. But a new legislation compels you all at once to update your current published version to push new information about the product: its weight for instance. Unfortunately your improvements on the product page are not completed and still you do not want to publish them. What can you do?

Akeneo PIM allows you to restore your published version in order to work on it and get back to your latest working copy afterwards. 

Restoring a version means reverting the product to an earlier version. For example, if you have 15 product versions, it is possible to go back to the version #5, which will not take into account any changes done afterwards.

In this example, restoring the version \#3 voids prices in euros and dollars and the image for the attribute “picture”.

Restoring a version does not delete information, but generates a new version representing the restored version.

In this example, the created version contains all changes generated by the restored Version #3, in this case: this will cancel the price and the picture changes.

It is possible to add weight to the product, save the change and publish it. Thus the published product form has not been changed, only the weight has been added.

To go back to the current version that is currently enriched (include the price and the picture), simply restore the version that contains the changes.

# How?

To restore a version:
1.  Go to Enrich/Products.
1.  Click on the product to restore.
