## Select a working locale

For each product page, it is possible to define your working locale. The selection of the locale impacts the following information on the Product Edit Form:
- The Family label in the product header,
- The Attribute groups label,
- The Attributes label,
- The Categories label,
- The Association label.

For the localizable attributes (with the indicated locale on top of the field), the entered values will be saved only for the working locale.

If you are working on several locales, you can edit one locale then another one and save all changes at once.

The localizable attributes for some locales exclusively (locale specific), are only displayed when they are concerned by the working locale.

::: info
The global attributes are displayed regardless of the working locale. Hence, these attributes can be edited in all working locales.
:::

To select your working locale:
Select the locale you want to work with.

In the drop-down menu, you will find the locales (at least those that have been added to a channel). If you cannot find your working locale listed, you have two options:
- You do not have the appropriate rights to view or edit the product for this locale. Please contact your administrator in this case.
- The locale is not required by any of the channels: therefore it is not enabled. To add a locale to a channel, please refer to the section “Channel configuration” in the PIM Administrator user guide.

## Select a working channel

To select the channel you want to edit:
Select your channel in the drop down list on the top of the Product Edit Form:

From the Product Edit Form:
