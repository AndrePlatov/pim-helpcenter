# Select your working context (channel/locale)

## Select your working channel

To select the channel you want to edit, select your channel in the drop down list on the header of the product form.

![image](../img/dummy.png)

If you want to edit several channels at once, you can edit the product information for one channel then another one and save all changes at once.

## Select your working locale

It is possible to define your working locale, the selection of the locale impacts the following information on the product form:
- The family label in the product infos
- The attribute groups label
- The attributes label
- The categories label
- The association label

To select your working locale, select the locale you want to work with on the header of the product form.

![image](../img/dummy.png)

In the drop-down menu, you will find the locales (at least those that have been added to a channel).  
If you cannot find your working locale listed, perhaps the locale is not required by any of the channels: therefore it is not enabled. To add a locale to a channel, please refer to [Manage your channels](/articles/manage-your-channels.html).


::: ee
Or, you do not have the appropriate rights to view the product values for this locale, please refer to the [Set rights on your catalog](/articles/access-rights-on-products.html) article.

For the localizable attributes (with the indicated locale on top right of the field), the entered values will be saved only for the working locale.

The localizable attributes for some locales exclusively (locale specific), are only displayed when they are concerned by the working locale.

If you are working on several locales, you can edit one locale then another one and save all changes at once.

::: info
The global attributes are displayed regardless of the working locale. Hence, these attributes can be edited in all working locales.
