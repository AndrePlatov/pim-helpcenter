## Spell-check on attribute labels and options

From the `Settings` you can check and improve the data quality of your attribute labels and options.

![Image data quality attribute grid](../img/data-quality-attribute-grid.png)

In the 'quality' column, you can view whether the data quality for your attribute is "Good" or "To improve".
If the status is "To improve", you may need to correct either attribute labels for one or several locales and/or attribute options for one or several locales.
