# About data quality
What is this **red, orange or green A, B, C, D, E displayed on my product edit form**? What are the **enrichment** and **consistency** grades?

**This is data quality insights!**

Because rich, coherent and consistent product data is important in order to deliver great product experiences, we introduced the concept of "data quality" in our PIM.  
This new capability helps you measure your data quality along two axes: **enrichment** and **consistency**.  
Each of these two axes has a score from A to E. The scores can be seen on several PIM screens.

::: tips
By disabling specific attribute groups in Akeneo settings, you can focus your enrichment and consistency status and progress on the most relevant product data for your end-customer needs. Therefore, you will get insights on whatâ€™s truly important to improve your Product Experience.

# How is enrichment calculated?
The **enrichment grade** is calculated as the percentage of attributes with values in your product edit form (whether the attributes are required for completeness or not).

We now know that an image is a must-have for a compelling product description. Our enrichment grade ensures that all your products have at least one image for your customers to see.

Checking the `data quality insights` panel in the product edit form allows you to quickly see which attributes need to be filled in to improve your data quality grade for enrichment.

::: tips
From the `data quality insights` panel, by clicking on the "Display all missing attributes", you can easily access a product edit form filtered on all the attributes that need to be filled in.

# How is consistency calculated?

The **consistency grade** is calculated on several criteria. The mix of the following criteria helps the PIM determine the grade for consistency:
- Spell check: localizable text and text areas, attribute labels and attribute options are checked for spelling mistakes.
- Uppercases formatting: the PIM checks whether text area attributes are correctly formatted for upper cases.
- Lowercases formatting: the PIM checks whether text area attributes are correctly formatted for lower cases.

::: info
Spell check is available for the English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Portuguese (Brazilian) locales.
Spell check is usable with localizable text and text area attributes.
If you use a single locale, then spell check is usable on text and text area attributes.

From the `data quality insights` panel, by clicking on the "Display all improvable attributes", you can easily access a product edit form filtered on all the attributes that need to be checked for consistency.

# Where to see data quality grades?
Data quality grades for **enrichment** and **consistency** are displayed as badges on PIM screens.

## On your dashboard
Your **dashboard** offers multiple ways of measuring your catalog's enrichment and consistency. You can choose to view data quality on the whole catalog, on a family, or on a category.

There are several types of recommendations:
- "Everything is good": all the checked attributes are correct.
- "Attribute label": attribute labels are clickable so you can improve them easily.
- "N/A": if the recommendation is "N/A" (Not Applicable) it means that the criteria is not relevant for the given product. For example, "N/A" will be displayed for spell-check if you don't have any localizable text or text area attributes.
- "In progress": the criteria is being checked.

# How often are the data quality grades refreshed?
The grades are updated:
- after an import,
- after a product is saved.
