# Overview

Attribute groups are used to gather attributes.

Gathering attributes together aims at giving more visibility when users fill in values.

# Example

For instance, you can group all attributes for Marketing in a group named “Marketing”. In the example below, we have three attribute groups displayed: Marketing, Technical and Media.

# In the Product Edit Form

Once you have created an attribute group, the group will appear automatically in your Product Edit Form if the product has at least one attribute in this group.

If no attribute group is used for the product family nor directly added to the product, then the group does not appear in the product page when you edit your product form. You can also add, delete, and define an order in groups.

# Specificity for EE

In the Enterprise Edition, you can define permissions on attribute groups, meaning you can define groups of users that are allowed to edit attributes belonging to the groups or only authorise them to view attribute’s values.

For instance, Marketing Content team will only be able to enrich attributes that have been added to the Marketing attribute group, they will be able to view Technical information though.
