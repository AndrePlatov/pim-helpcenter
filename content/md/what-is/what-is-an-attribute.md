# Definition of an attribute

An attribute is a productâ€™s characteristic. Each product is composed of different attributes.

Depending on your Akeneo Edition version, you can have up to 13 attribute types:
- text and text area
- simple or multiselect
- [reference data](/articles/what-is-a-reference-data.html)
- boolean (yes/no)
- date
- number
- price
- metric (with automatic conversions)
- media file: a simple file or an image
- [assets](/articles/work-with-assets.html): digital resources like a video, picture, pdf file... _(Entreprise Edition only)_

Attributes are gathered into [attribute groups](/articles/what-is-an-attribute-group.html) in Akeneo.

# Attribute properties
An attribute can have several specific properties: it can be localizable, locale specific and/or scopable.

::: info
You can mix and match attribute properties to achieve a powerful result.
:::

## _Localisable_ attribute

A localisable attribute can have different values per locale.  
This allows you to manage a product translations according to the activated PIM locales.  

For instance, a localisable attribute will enable you to have one product name for each locale activated in your PIM. It is mostly used for text or (simple or multi) select attributes.

## _Locale specific_ attribute

Some attributes can be shown only for specific locales. We will call them locale specific.

For instance, a cold resistance attribute for Russia, a Canadian tax only for Canada.

## _Scopable_ attribute

Finally, an attribute can be scopable. An attribute is scopable if its values differ for each channel.

For instance, you might want:
- a short description for your e-commerce website
- a even shorter for your mobile app
- a long one for your print catalog

# Validation parameters

In order to control your data quality, you can add validation parameters to some of your attributes.  
For instance, you can add a regular expression on a text field to use it for EAN codes. As they contain 13 digits, we can add a validation rule based on the following regular expression: `/^[0-9]{13}$/`
