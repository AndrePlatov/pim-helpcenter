# Definition

In Akeneo, you can have multiple category trees with an unlimited number of levels (categories, subcategories, subsubcategories..).

# Key rules

- A product that does not belong to a category will not be exported.

# EE specificity
In the Enterprise Edition, you can define specific user rights on categories.
