# What's the use case?

Let's take an example of a product page.  
There are many types of product information such as text, images...  
Some information are shared between different products (such as the definition of care instructions, colors or brands).  
This shared information has its own attributes (eg a label, a description, an image for the brand).  
They may have dedicated pages on the e-commerce website (eg dedicated pages for brands) or their information may enrich each product page.

# What's a reference entity?

A **reference entity** allows you to create and enrich natively in the PIM those **common information** which are **linked to products**.   
A reference entity has its **own attributes**, its **own lifecycle** and can be linked to products.  
It allows enriching common data related to products with a rich content (description, images...), more complex than just a code and labels.

For example, you can create a reference entity to manage brands, ranges, manufacturers, colors, materials, care instructions...

Let's take an example with an entity "Brand" and a list of brands (Kartell, Alessi, Fatboy, Fermob...). A brand is described by the following information: a code, a label, an image, a country, a designer, a foundation date, a photo and a description.


# What's a record?

A record contains all information about a reference entity. For example for the "Brands" reference entity, a record could be the information regarding the brand "Kartell".
A record may be related to one or more products.

# How to create your 1st reference entity and its records?
