title: What is a **locale**?
---

# Definition
An Akeneo locale is a combination of a language (English, German, French...) and a country (United States, United Kingdom, France…).

### Examples
English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU). 

You can have one or more locales activated in your PIM.

A product in Akeneo can have different values per locale for some attributes; these attributes are named _“localizable”_.

The locales are used to set values for attributes which may differ according to the relevant language/locale.

Akeneo offers more than 200 locales by default that you can activate following your needs.

# EE specificity
In the Enterprise Edition, you can define specific user rights on locales.
