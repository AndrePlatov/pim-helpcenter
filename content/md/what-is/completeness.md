# Definition
The completeness is an information displayed as a progress bar or as a percentage in the PIM. It is calculated for each product (it represents the percentage of completion of a product) and for each combination channel/locale.

A product is considered as complete (or 100% completeness) when its required attributes (defined at the family level) have values.
