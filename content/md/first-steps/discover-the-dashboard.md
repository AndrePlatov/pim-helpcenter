## Completeness over channels and locales

Below the projects, you will have an overview of your channels and locales completenesses. In our example, we have 3 channels: Mobile, Print and Ecommerce. Each channel has 3 activated locales: German (de_DE), English (en_UK) and French (fr_FR). For each locales we have the enrichment’s progress bar (how complete my products are?), the number of products completed vs the total number of products. All products are displayed on this widget, regardless your permissions on the product’s categories.

## Last operations

At the bottom of the dashboard, you will see the last PIM operations: latest imports and exports, latest updates performed in the UI or run automatically. For each operation, you will have a status (completed/failed) and a shortcut to the operation details. To bring you more visibility on the job’s status, it is displayed in green when successfull (no warnings), yellow when successfull but with warnings, and red when it is failed.
