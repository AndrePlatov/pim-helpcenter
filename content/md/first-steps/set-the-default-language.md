# The PIM interface language

You can set a default language for the interface, that will be used for all new users.

Most user interfaces in the PIM are translated in other languages than English.

Note that each user can configure the interface in its own language.

For instance, your German team can have the PIM interface in German, whereas the US team will have the PIM in American English - this can be set in their user account.

# Choose the default language

1.  Log in with a user account with the rights to “System” menu.
1.  Go to System/Configuration
