# How to create a measurement family?

**Measurement families are used to store product information information with measurement i.e. weight, height or power inside the PIM**.    
For more details about measurements, please read [this article](what-is-a-measurement.html).      

To create a new measurement family, follow these steps:
1.  Go to `Settings/Measurements`
1.  Click on `Create`
![Create a measurement family](../img/Settings_Families_Create.png)
1.  The pop-in to create a measurement family is displayed
1.  Input the new measurement family code and its label in the current UI locale
1.  Input the code, label and symbol of the standard unit for this measurement family (the standard unit is used to convert the other units)
1.  Click on `Save`

The measurement family is now created and the screen to add others units opens.

::: warning
The standard unit is set once and for all.

:::info
To guarantee that the PIM is functional and runs smoothly, we defined a volume limitation of 100 measurement families. If you try to create more than 100 measurement families, you will have a blocking message.
