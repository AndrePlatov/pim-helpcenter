# The basics

Once you've [created your 1st reference entity](manage-your-reference-entities.html) and [created your user groups](build-your-user-groups.html), you can begin to define for each of these users groups if they will be able to see/edit this reference entity.

# Rights depending on the reference entity

For reference entities, we have 2 levels of access: the view right and the edition right.

::: warning
Itâ€™s to hide a reference entity.

## The edition right
If a user belonging to a user group that has right to edit a reference entity, he will be able to:
*   Edit the reference entities properties
*   Add, edit, delete the reference entities Attributes
*   Add, edit, delete a reference entity record
*   Delete the reference entity

:::info
At least one user group must have the right to edit a reference entity.
:::

## The view right
If a user belonging to a user group that has right to display a reference entity, he will only be able to view the reference entity information (properties, attributes, records) and that's all.
He will have to possibility to edit or delete it.

# Rights depending on the locales
It is possible to define for each [user group](what-is-a-user-group.html), on which [locale](what-is-a-locale.html) the reference entity information can be viewed and/or edited.
