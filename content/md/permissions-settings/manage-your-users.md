# Overview

The user management and their access rights is available only if the rights have been given to the user.

Any PIM user can see his own account details, update his/her password, and set his/her preferences (eg working environment for locale and channel for example).

::: info
All users in the PIM can see the firstname and lastname of other users in the application.
