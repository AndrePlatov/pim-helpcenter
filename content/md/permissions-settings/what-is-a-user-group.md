# Definition

A user group is a set of users grouped by a name. A user may be a part of several user groups. For example, the user group “Marketing Dpt” gathers all the users in the Marketing Department of the company. The user group “Managers” gathers all the users who are manager of a department. Some users can be in the “Marketing Dpt” only.

Advanced permissions can be applied on user groups in the Enterprise Edition. In the Community Edition, there is no permission applied on user groups.
